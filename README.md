WhatsAppTracker
===============

A simple android application to help enthusiasts keep up with the latest WhatsApp versions as they
are uploaded at www.whatsapp.com/android

These latest versions are always under testing and are packed with the new features that are to be added to the official stable version that gets uploaded to the Google Play Store.

Inspired by Laurent Ninga( https://plus.google.com/112939850134979360366/about ) who would always have to visit whatsapp.com to check new versions, I deciced to make his life simple by bbuilding this application.
